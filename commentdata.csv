Bill is spewing the same BS as all climate change a**holes are babbling on about!! Why dont we talk about what the governments are doing to hoax us into believing there is climate change. The chem trail spraying...this is not a conspiracy it has been documented and proven. Also HARP and the manipulation of the atmosphere. Anyone not familiar with what HARP can do and what it is...take a look.
And there are several of these installments around the globe, and it can do more than the official explanation. 
So until the governments start coming clean on their manipulation of the atmosphere...they have no right to tell me what to do in the meantime!! And for anyone who is buying this BS that the average person and cow farts are the reason for global warming...I dont blame you for believing that...but dont take the claims at face value. If you dig deep into those who are vocal on the subject you will find most all have something to gain by pushing this narrative.
